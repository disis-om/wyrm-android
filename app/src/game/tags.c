/*
 * A tag is a bobble on the end of a rope, and the rope is a real one.
 *
 * This is the mod's own mechanism in the mod's own numbers, read off the draw
 * path in `main-mt.js` rather than off a summary of it — the last two attempts
 * at this were written from a summary and both were wrong. Ten points, each
 * pulled towards a spot a little past the point in front of it and then damped,
 * with a hard limit on how far two neighbours may drift apart. The bobble hangs
 * off the last point, not off the head, and turns to face the last segment.
 * Because the tip lags, the bobble lags; because the chain is springy, it
 * overshoots and settles.
 *
 * Two things here are easy to get subtly wrong and were:
 *
 *   The rope is anchored and seeded along `ang`, the direction the snake is
 *   actually travelling — not along the eased angle the head sprite is drawn
 *   at. The mod uses its heading for the tag and its eased angle for the eyes,
 *   and they are different fields for a reason.
 *
 *   The pull only ever maintains the direction the chain already points, so a
 *   rope laid down facing the wrong way stays facing the wrong way for as long
 *   as the snake lives. Everything that decides the initial direction therefore
 *   has to be right, and a rope that has gone bad has to be dropped rather than
 *   nursed. `rope_broken` is that drop.
 *
 * The numbers are written up in ntl-tags.md.
